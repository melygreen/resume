        <h2>Build & Release / QA Professional</h2>
        <p>I began my journey as a QA Engineer while I attended college. I soon became a Build Engineer and held that title for the duration of my career. During which time I have worked on a number of projects to build my skill set. </p>
        <p>After a small <em>"sabbatical"</em> to sow my thirst for entrepreneurship, I have an amazing drive to learn and grow further in my software career.</p>
